          <h1>Understanding Online Threats</h1>
          <p>
            Staying safe online requires understanding the basic threats you
            face. Keeping your devices free of malware, and avoiding falling for
            phishing attacks is fundimental to staying safe. The following are
            some of the most common threats that normal internet users face, and
            how to avoid falling for them. Click the sections below to learn
            about each type of threat.
          </p>

          <button type="button" class="collapsible">Malware</button>
          <div class="content1 text-left">
            <p>
              The impact of malware depends on the type of malware, and can
              range from slowing down your computer to stealing passwords and
              credit card numbers to encrypting your files and demanding a
              ransom to decrypt them. At the end of the day, you cannot operate
              securely online if the device you use is compromised.
            </p>
            <p>
              While antivirus solutions can help detect and clean up infections
              after they happen, the best approach is to avoid infections in the
              first place. To do this, avoid visiting untrusted websites;
              websites like movie and music privacy sites, or other illegal
              sites should be avoided as they have been known to distribute
              malware. If you do need to visit a site that you don't trust, do
              so in a virtual machine. If a website downloads a file
              unexpectedly, close the website, delete the file, and run an
              antivirus scan.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, do not download or open files that you don't trust.
              Be especially wary of files sent to you by email, check the
              senders email address before downloading any files, and do not
              download any files you are not expecting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regarding antivirus, Windows Defender comes with Windows, and is
              sufficient for that operating system. Sophos is one good option
              for Mac, or for Windows if something besides Windows Defender is
              desired. For Linux, ClamAV is a good option. Always use real
              antivirus. One of the most commonly types of pirated software is
              antivirus software. Usually, predicatbly, these pirated versions
              contain malware. If you don't want to pay for antivirus, it's much
              better not to install it at all than to install a pirated version.

            Phishing, Scam Pages, and Social Engineering
          </button>
          <div class="content1 text-left">
            <p>
              Truly hacking most websites these days is very difficult. Users
              are often the weakest links, and hackers take advantage of this.
              Taking advantage of users' weaknesses rather than weaknesses in
              code or website design is called social engineering. Below are
              some of the most common ways users are tricked into giving hackers
              sensitive information. As general guidance, be extremely aware
              whenever you type or paste your password into a website, or enter
              authentication codes or personal information anywhere. Always
              check the URL, if it looks weird, don't enter your password. Don't
              ever give authentication codes, passwords, or personal information
              in text messages or over the phone to anyone. Hackers will often
              call or text victims and trick them into giving them sensitive
              information, for example by pretending to a bank employee. Do not
              fall for it, this a very common way for people to loose control of
              their accounts to hackers. Hackers will often use fear to help
              scare victims into providing this information. Watch out for this
              tactic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phishing is one of the most common ways of taking advantage of
              users. Hackers will use email, text messages, or phone calls to
              trick users into entering their credentials into fake websites
              (see the section on scam pages below) or into sending the hacker
              passwords or authentication codes over email, text, or by phone.
              Another trick is to try to get victims to buy gift cards, and send
              them to the hacker. For example, they may pretend to be your boss,
              or the pastor of your church, and ask you to buy gift cards for a
              urgent business need or a family in needs, and they will reimburse
              you later. Hackers can also get access to an account by using the
              "forgot password" function, which usually requires personal
              information as verification. They can then often trick victims
              into giving them this information by email, text, or phone. Never
              send codes, passwords, or personal information by text, phone, or
              email.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scam pages are when hackers create a web page that looks like the
              login page of a legitimate website. For example, they may create a
              web page that looks like a bank login page. Then they send bank
              customers emails saying there is problem with their account, or
              someone has withdrawn a substantial amount of money, and ask them
              to sign in to verify the transaction, including a link to their
              fake bank website in the email. When the victim clicks on the link
              and enters their password, the password is sent to the hackers.
              Sometimes these pages will also ask for the code sent by text
              message to verify the log in, allowing the hacker to bypass this
              additional security check if the victim enters this code. To avoid
              falling for this scam, never click on links in emails. If your
              bank sends you an email and asks for action, navigate to the bank
              website directly, and log in from there. Do not use the link
              provided in the email. Before entering an email, carefully check
              the URL. Hackers will use URLs that look similar on first glace to
              the true URL. For example, instead of secure.bankofamerica.com a
              hacker might use secure.bankofamarica.com. Watch out for these
              URLs. Don't click links in emails or text messages.

            Credential Stuffing Attacks
          </button>
          <div class="content1 text-left">
            <p>
              One of the most common ways passwords are compromised is
              credential stuffing attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Databases containing username password combinations are obtained
              by hackers from by breaching websites, or because the databases
              are sometimes left unprotected. These hackers either sell the
              databases on the dark web, or use the data themselves. They test
              the username-password combinations from the database against other
              websites, this is called credential stuffing. Because users so
              often reuse usernames and passwords across multiple websites,
              credential stuffing results in a relatively large number of valid
              sets of credentials. The hacker can then sell these valid
              credentials, or take advantage of them themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              The two best means of protection against these attacks is two
              factor authentication and never reusing passwords. How to do this
              will be covered in the passwords and two factor authentication
              guides. It is also helpful to use different usernames or emails
              for different services, especially high value accounts such as
              bank accounts. This will also be covered in the passwords section.

          <button type="button" class="collapsible">Public WiFi</button>
          <div class="content1 text-left">
            <p>
              Using public WiFi, especially for sensitive applications such as
              banking, opens you up to potential attacks. People on the same
              network, especially if the network is unsecured, can run attacks
              such as SSL stripping attacks that can reveal credentials in plain
              text. Because of this, when using public WiFi, consider using a
              VPN. If you don't use a VPN, avoid logging in to any accounts
              while on public WiFi, and avoid doing anything sensitive on the
              public WiFi network. Additionally, do not use free VPNs, they make
              money by selling data about your internet usage while you are
              connected to the VPN. Instead, use a reputable, paid VPN service
              like ProtonVPN, NordVPN, PIA, or ExpressVPN. ProtonVPN does have a
              free tier, as a reputable, paid VPN provider, it is likely safe to
              use if you require a free VPN.
