          <h1>Understanding Online Threats</h1>
          <p>
            Staying safe online requires understanding the basic threats you
            face. Keeping your devices free of malware, and avoiding falling for
            phishing attacks is fundimental to staying safe. The following are
            some of the most common threats that normal internet users face, and
            how to avoid falling for them. Click the sections below to learn
            about each type of threat.

                    The impact of malware depends on the type of malware, and
                    can range from slowing down your computer to stealing
                    passwords and credit card numbers to encrypting your files
                    and demanding a ransom to decrypt them. At the end of the
                    day, you cannot operate securely online if the device you
                    use is compromised.

                    While antivirus solutions can help detect and clean up
                    infections after they happen, the best approach is to avoid
                    infections in the first place. To do this, avoid visiting
                    untrusted websites; websites like movie and music privacy
                    sites, or other illegal sites should be avoided as they have
                    been known to distribute malware. If you do need to visit a
                    site that you don't trust, do so in a virtual machine. If a
                    website downloads a file unexpectedly, close the website,
                    delete the file, and run an antivirus scan.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-start">
                    Additionally, do not download or open files that you don't
                    trust. Be especially wary of files sent to you by email,
                    check the senders email address before downloading any
                    files, and do not download any files you are not expecting.
                  </p>

                    Regarding antivirus, Windows Defender comes with Windows,
                    and is sufficient for that operating system. Sophos is one
                    good option for Mac, or for Windows if something besides
                    Windows Defender is desired. For Linux, ClamAV is a good
                    option. Always use real antivirus. One of the most commonly
                    types of pirated software is antivirus software. Usually,
                    predicatbly, these pirated versions contain malware. If you
                    don't want to pay for antivirus, it's much better not to
                    install it at all than to install a pirated version.

                    Truly hacking most websites these days is very difficult.
                    Users are often the weakest links, and hackers take
                    advantage of this. Taking advantage of users' weaknesses
                    rather than weaknesses in code or website design is called
                    social engineering. Below are some of the most common ways
                    users are tricked into giving hackers sensitive information.
                    As general guidance, be extremely aware whenever you type or
                    paste your password into a website, or enter authentication
                    codes or personal information anywhere. Always check the
                    URL, if it looks weird, don't enter your password. Don't
                    ever give authentication codes, passwords, or personal
                    information in text messages or over the phone to anyone.
                    Hackers will often call or text victims and trick them into
                    giving them sensitive information, for example by pretending
                    to a bank employee. Do not fall for it, this a very common
                    way for people to loose control of their accounts to
                    hackers. Hackers will often use fear to help scare victims
                    into providing this information. Watch out for this tactic.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-start">
                    Phishing is one of the most common ways of taking advantage
                    of users. Hackers will use email, text messages, or phone
                    calls to trick users into entering their credentials into
                    fake websites (see the section on scam pages below) or into
                    sending the hacker passwords or authentication codes over
                    email, text, or by phone. Another trick is to try to get
                    victims to buy gift cards, and send them to the hacker. For
                    example, they may pretend to be your boss, or the pastor of
                    your church, and ask you to buy gift cards for a urgent
                    business need or a family in needs, and they will reimburse
                    you later. Hackers can also get access to an account by
                    using the "forgot password" function, which usually requires
                    personal information as verification. They can then often
                    trick victims into giving them this information by email,
                    text, or phone. Never send codes, passwords, or personal
                    information by text, phone, or email.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-start">
                    Scam pages are when hackers create a web page that looks
                    like the login page of a legitimate website. For example,
                    they may create a web page that looks like a bank login
                    page. Then they send bank customers emails saying there is
                    problem with their account, or someone has withdrawn a
                    substantial amount of money, and ask them to sign in to
                    verify the transaction, including a link to their fake bank
                    website in the email. When the victim clicks on the link and
                    enters their password, the password is sent to the hackers.
                    Sometimes these pages will also ask for the code sent by
                    text message to verify the log in, allowing the hacker to
                    bypass this additional security check if the victim enters
                    this code. To avoid falling for this scam, never click on
                    links in emails. If your bank sends you an email and asks
                    for action, navigate to the bank website directly, and log
                    in from there. Do not use the link provided in the email.
                    Before entering an email, carefully check the URL. Hackers
                    will use URLs that look similar on first glace to the true
                    URL. For example, instead of secure.bankofamerica.com a
                    hacker might use secure.bankofamarica.com. Watch out for
                    these URLs. Don't click links in emails or text messages.

                    Databases containing username password combinations are
                    obtained by hackers from by breaching websites, or because
                    the databases are sometimes left unprotected. These hackers
                    either sell the databases on the dark web, or use the data
                    themselves. They test the username-password combinations
                    from the database against other websites, this is called
                    credential stuffing. Because users so often reuse usernames
                    and passwords across multiple websites, credential stuffing
                    results in a relatively large number of valid sets of
                    credentials. The hacker can then sell these valid
                    credentials, or take advantage of them themselves.

                    The two best means of protection against these attacks is
                    two factor authentication and never reusing passwords. How
                    to do this will be covered in the passwords and two factor
                    authentication guides. It is also helpful to use different
                    usernames or emails for different services, especially high
                    value accounts such as bank accounts. This will also be
                    covered in the passwords section.

                    Using public WiFi, especially for sensitive applications
                    such as banking, opens you up to potential attacks. People
                    on the same network, especially if the network is unsecured,
                    can run attacks such as SSL stripping attacks that can
                    reveal credentials in plain text. Because of this, when
                    using public WiFi, consider using a VPN. If you don't use a
                    VPN, avoid logging in to any accounts while on public WiFi,
                    and avoid doing anything sensitive on the public WiFi
                    network. Additionally, do not use free VPNs, they make money
                    by selling data about your internet usage while you are
                    connected to the VPN. Instead, use a reputable, paid VPN
                    service like ProtonVPN, NordVPN, PIA, or ExpressVPN.
                    ProtonVPN does have a free tier, as a reputable, paid VPN
                    provider, it is likely safe to use if you require a free
                    VPN.
