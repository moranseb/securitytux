                    There are a few ways your credit card information can be
                    stolen. First, your device that you use to shop online can
                    be compromised. Credential and information stealing malware
                    can steal your credit card number if you have it saved in
                    your browser, or if you make a purchase while infected. Make
                    sure whatever device you use to shop online is secure and
                    free of malware. Also, don't visit sketchy sites from the
                    same device you use to shop. Use a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.howtogeek.com/196060/beginner-geek-how-to-create-and-use-virtual-machines/"
                      >virtual machine</a
                    >
                    if you absolutely have to visit a site you don't trust, but
                    it's better to avoid them all together.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Second, your credit card infomation can be involved in a
                    breach. If a website you've shopped at is breached, your
                    payment information could be compromised. To avoid this, use
                    virtual cards from
                    <a href="https://privacy.com/">privacy.com</a>. See more on
                    this in the next section. These breaches happen most often
                    to smaller, outdated websites. You are very unlikely to have
                    your credit card compromised because a big company like
                    Amazon was breached. Because of this, avoid entering your
                    payment information into sites you don't trust. Some smaller
                    sites may use third party payment processors. This is
                    usually safe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Third, an account where your credit card information is
                    saved could be breached. If your Amazon account is
                    compromised, for example because you used a password you've
                    used elsewhere, an attacker may be able to steal your
                    payment information from your account. To avoid this, make
                    sure any accounts where you save payment information are
                    secured with strong passwords and 2FA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last, your payment information could be stolen by a credit
                    card skimmer. These are physical devices that criminals
                    attach to payment terminals, especially at gas stations.
                    Before swiping your card, you can pull hard on the payment
                    terminal to make sure there is no skimmer attached. If a
                    payment terminal looks strange or different from other ones
                    around it, avoid using it. Skimmers are placed over top of
                    existing card terminals, so watch out of particularly bulky
                    or pertruding terminals. For more infomration on spotting
                    skimmers, check out this article:

                    Virtual cards, such as those offered by
                    <a href="https://privacy.com">privacy.com</a>, allow you to
                    generate multiple payment cards when shopping online. There
                    are various controls you can use when using these cards. You
                    can create "one time use" cards that close and decline all
                    subsequent transactions after being used, or you can have a
                    card that will lock to the first merchant it is used at.
                    This means if you make a card for Amazon shopping, after it
                    is used at Amazon, it cannot be used anywhere else. You can
                    also set spend limits per week, month, or year on each card.
                    If this limit is exceeded, the card will decline. These
                    virtual cards help eliminate much of the risk from online
                    shopping. If you card is breached, hackers will not be able
                    to use it at other merchants. If it was a one time card,
                    they won't be able to use it at all, and if the card is
                    still usable, but has a limit, they will only be able to use
                    it at the merchant the card is locked to, and will not be
                    able to exceed the limit placed on the card. Additionally,
                    these cards help lessen the inconvenience of having payment
                    information stolen. Instead of cancelling you credit card
                    and having to update your billing information everywhere,
                    you can cancel just the one virtual card that was breached.
