          <button type="button" class="collapsible">How it Happens</button>
          <div class="content1 text-left">
            <p>
              There are a few ways your credit card information can be stolen.
              First, your device that you use to shop online can be compromised.
              Credential and information stealing malware can steal your credit
              card number if you have it saved in your browser, or if you make a
              purchase while infected. Make sure whatever device you use to shop
              online is secure and free of malware. Also, don't visit sketchy
              sites from the same device you use to shop. Use a Virtual Machine
              if you absolutely have to visit a site you don't trust, but it's
              better to avoid them all together.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, your credit card infomation can be involved in a breach.
              If a website you've shopped at is breached, your payment
              information could be compromised. To avoid this, use virtual cards
              from privacy.com. See more on this in the next section. These
              breaches happen most often to smaller, outdated websites. You are
              very unlikely to have your credit card compromised because a big
              company you shop at like Amazon was breached. Because of this,
              avoid entering your payment information into sites you don't
              trust. Some smaller sites may use third party payment processors.
              This is usually safe.
            </p>
            <p>
              Third, an account where your credit card information is saved
              could be breached. If your Amazon account is breach, for example
              because you use a password you've used elsewhere, an attacker may
              be able to steal your payment information from your account. To
              avoid this, make sure any accounts where you save payment
              information are secured with strong passwords and 2FA.
            </p>
            <p>
              Last, your payment information could be stolen by a credit card
              skimmer. These are physical devices that criminals attach to
              payment terminals, especially at gas stations. Before swiping your
              card, you can pull hard on the payment terminal to make sure there
              is no skimmer attached. If a payment terminal looks strange or
              different from other ones around it, avoid using it. Skimmers are
              placed over top of existing card terminals, so watch out of
              particularly bulky or pertruding terminals. For more infomration

          <button type="button" class="collapsible">Virtual Cards</button>
          <div class="content1 text-left">
            <p>
              Virtual cards, such as those offered by privacy.com, allow you to
              generate multiple payment cards when shopping online. There are
              various controls you can use when using these cards. You can
              create "One time use" cards that close and decline all subsequent
              transactions after being used, or you can have a card that will
              lock to the first merchant it is used at. This means if you make a
              card for Amazon shopping, after it is used at Amazon, it cannot be
              used anywhere else. You can also set spend limits per week, month,
              or year on each card. If this limit is exceeded, the card will
              decline. These virtual cards help eliminate much of the risk from
              online shopping. If you card is breached, hackers will not be able
              to use it at other merchants. If it was a one time card, they
              won't be able to use it at all, and if the card is still usable,
              but has a limit, they will only be able to use it at the merchant
              the card is locked to, and will not be able to exceed the limit
              placed on the card. Additionally, these cards help lessen the
              inconvenience of having payment information stolen. Instead of
              cancelling you credit card and having to update your billing
              information everywhere, you can cancel just the one virtual card
              that was breached.
