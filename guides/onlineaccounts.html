                    An good password is one that you only use in one place, is
                    long, and is as random as possible. This means is should not
                    include dictionary words, it should have upper and lower
                    case letters, symbols, and generally should be at least 15
                    characters. Generating random passwords and remembering
                    different passwords for every site where you have an account
                    is impossible. To solve this problem, there are password
                    managers. These are apps that are password protected that
                    store all your other passwords. Because they contain all
                    your other log in credentials, it is extremely important
                    that you properly protect your password manager. This means
                    using a strong, random password that you have never used
                    anywhere else. You can use this site to generate a strong
                    password for your password manager:
                    <a href="https://1password.com/password-generator/"
                      >https://1password.com/password-generator/</a
                    >. I recommend unchecking the "Full Words" box, and
                    replacing at least one of the dashes with a number.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some people use notes applications or spreadsheets to keep
                    track of their passwords. This is not recommended. Password
                    managers, besides being much easier to use, are much more
                    secure. Password managers are built with security as the
                    primary goal, notes apps and spreadsheets are much easier
                    for hackers to steal using malware or unauthorized access to
                    your online accounts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, your password manager should have two factor
                    authentication enabled, see the below section on two factor
                    authentication.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For choice of password manager, I highly recommend
                    1Password. It is extremely affordable at $2.99 a month for
                    an individual, and $4.99 a month for a family (with up to 5
                    users). This is the best option in my opinion. If you prefer
                    a free option, (although they also have a paid tier) I would
                    recommend Bitwarden. I would not recommend LastPass due to
                    their history of being breached. Proton and NordVPN both
                    have started password managers. I have not used them, but
                    given the reputation of these companies, they likely are
                    good products. However they are newer products without the
                    same history as Bitwarden and 1Password.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Do not save passwords in Chrome or Firefox, they are
                    trivially easy to steal if your computer is compromised,
                    they are practically stored in plain text on your computer.
                    Additionally, do not save passwords using your Google or
                    Apple account, use a dedicated password manager. Because
                    email addresses can often be used as a backup second
                    authentication method, if someone gains access to your
                    google or apple account, and your passwords are stored
                    there, they likely will have full access to most of your
                    online accounts.

                    Two Factor Authentication (or 2FA) is a second piece of
                    information required from a user in order to log in to an
                    account. Often these are time-based, meaning a particular
                    two-factor authentication code is only valid for a set
                    period of time. There are four major types of 2FA, listed
                    here in order from worst to best: SMS based, email based,
                    software based, and hardware based.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    SMS based 2FA uses a code sent to your phone that usually
                    expires in 5 to 10 minutes. SMS based 2FA is often used by
                    banks, and is vulnerable to SIM swapping, and attack where a
                    criminal takes over a victim's phone number. SIM swaps and
                    compromised passwords are the source of many compromised
                    bank accounts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Email based 2FA uses codes sent to your email address. A
                    properly secured email account with a strong password and
                    software or hardware based 2FA can be very secure. However,
                    bear in mind that employees of your email service provider
                    can gain access to your emails, and can also sometimes
                    restore email access if you lock yourself out. There have
                    been cases when hackers have called their victim's email
                    service provider pretending to be their victim, and were
                    able to reset the victim's email account password. Using an
                    email provider like Protonmail that is security focused and
                    employs zero knowledge encryption helps mitigate this risk
                    greatly, as employees are less likely to be able or willing
                    to reset an account's password. Using common email providers
                    like Yahoo or Gmail for email based 2FA is not recommended.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Software based 2FA uses a seed code and the time of day to
                    create a six digit code that you enter into a website.
                    Because the seed code is never entered into a website, and
                    is often stored locally or in specially designed, secure
                    applications, this method of 2FA is considered very secure.
                    I highly recommend backing up your 2FA seed codes, however,
                    often when you enable 2FA, the website will provide you with
                    backup codes. In this case, backing up the seed code is not
                    nessisary, add the backup codes to the notes section in your
                    password manager. 1Password and Bitwarden paid tiers
                    provides the option to save 2FA software codes in the app,
                    and the app will generate verification codes. You can also
                    just add the seed code in the notes section for a login as a
                    backup, while using another app to generate verification
                    codes. Regardless, you will also need a 2FA app specifically
                    for your password manager. For a dedicated 2FA app, I would
                    recommend Authy. I would avoid Google and Microsoft
                    Authenticator due to privacy concerns, but if you don't
                    share these concerns these apps also work well.
                  </p>

                    In the image below you can see a screenshot from enabling
                    2FA in bitwarden. The QR code would be scanned with an app
                    or a password manager. The alphanumeric code below the QR
                    code is the seed code. If the site did not provide backup
                    codes (bitwarden does), this seed code should be backed up
                    in your password manager or another secure location, such as
                    a thumb drive.

                    Hardware based 2FA uses a physical security key, often a USB
                    key that you plug into the computer to verify your identity.
                    These are considered the most secure method of 2FA. Yubico
                    Authenticator keys are a great option for hardware based
                    authentication keys. If you use hardware keys, make sure to
                    buy two, and add both keys to each account where you use a
                    hardware key. Then carry one with you, and keep one is a
                    secure location. You don't want to be locked out of all you
                    accounts because you lost your key ring.

                    Once you have your passwords in a password manager, it is
                    extremely important to maintain access to your password
                    manager. There are multiple ways of doing this. For example,
                    1Password provides an "emergency kit" with your Secret Key,
                    and your master password (make sure to add your seed code if
                    you have 2FA enabled). With Bitwarden, you can make your own
                    emergency kit by noting your password and 2FA seed or backup
                    code in a text file or on paper. Storing this in a safe
                    place, physically in a locked safe or filing cabinet, or
                    digitally on a thumb drive stored in a locked location or
                    password protected, will let you recover access to your
                    account if you forget your password or if your logged in
                    devices are lost or destroyed. You can also store this
                    information in the password manager of a trusted friend
                    family member. Remember that they can use this information
                    to log into your password manager and access all your
                    accounts. Only give this information to someone you trust
                    absolutely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If storing your emergency kit digitally, after copying the
                    information to a thumb drive, make sure the file is erased
                    from your computer. This information should not be stored on
                    any device connected to the internet, and it is easy to
                    forget to delete the file after copying to a thumb drive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you ever need to recover a 2FA code, all 2FA apps have an
                    option to manually enter the 2FA seed code. Once you enter
                    your backedup seed code, the app will start generating
                    verification codes for the account.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To reiterate, if you use Bitwarden, make sure to enable 2FA.
                    1Password uses a secret key, so this is less important, but
                    still a good idea. After this is set up, make sure that you
                    have everything you need to log back into your password
                    manager (password, Secret Key if applicable, and 2FA seed
                    code) stored in a safe, secure location offline. If you
                    forget and loose your password manager password, the
                    password manager company will not be able to restore your
                    access or recover your passwords.

                    The following are the steps to securely set up a Bitwarden
                    account. Setting up 1Password is very similar, and more
                    intuitive, so a step-by-step is not provided for that
                    platform.

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Ensure you have a 2FA app downloaded and ready to use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Go to hxxps://bitwarden[.]com/, and click get started in
                      the top right corner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Use your email address to sign up, ensure the email you
                      use to sign up is secure and has 2FA enabled. Some people
                      prefer to have an email address used only for high
                      security accounts such as banking and password managers. I
                      recommend this approach, but it is not stricly nessisary
                      especially if your standard email account is secured
                      properly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Use a password you have not used anywhere else, and do not
                      use a variation of passwords you have used elsewhere. See
                      the passwords section above for advice on creating a
                      secure password.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Create your account and verify your email address. (You
                      will be sent an email with a verification link, click that
                      link to verify your email. If you do not receive this
                      email, there is an option in the website version to resend
                      the email)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Download the desktop application, as well as the mobile
                      application if desired, and sign in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In the web version, click the profile image in the top
                      right corner, then click “Account Settings”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      On the left side, navigate to Security, then on the top
                      bar, select “Two-step login”
                    </li>
                    <li>Next to “authenticator app” click “manage”.</li>
                    <li>Enter your password.</li>
                    <li>
                      Scan the QR code using your chosen authenticator app. Copy
                      the code below the QR code to your clipboard (This is
                      called a seed code). Do NOT click enable yet. (Note that
                      you can add 2FA access to multiple apps by scanning this
                      code from multiple authenticator apps, for example if you
                      want to have a trusted friend or partner to also add your
                      account to their authenticator app to ensure you maintain
                      access to the account. )
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Open your Bitwarden Desktop App, select the + at the
                      bottom, and create a login with the name “Bitwarden Seed
                      Code”. Paste the code from below the QR code into the
                      password field. No username is required. Save the entry.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In the web version of Bitwarden, enter the six digit code
                      from your authenticator app, and now click enable. (You
                      may be required to enter an authenticator code into the
                      desktop and mobile applications after enabling Two-step
                      login.) Your password manager is now ready to use and
                      secure. Next you will make sure you retain access to the
                      password manager in case you loose access to your
                      authenticator app.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      As mentioned above, you need to backup the password and
                      the 2FA seed code. You can write down the code and
                      password and keep it in a very secure place, such as in a
                      safe. You can also store it on a USB flash drive,
                      preferably encrypted. (SanDisk USB drives come with easy
                      out of the box encryption capabilities.) Of course make
                      sure you do not lose the password to the encrypted drive.
                      Do whatever makes the most sense for your situation, but
                      ensure that you do not lose your password manager password
                      or seed code.
