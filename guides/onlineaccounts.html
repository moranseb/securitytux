          <div class="content1 text-left">
            <p>
              An good password is one that you only use in one place, is long,
              and is as random as possible. This means is should not include
              dictionary words, it should have upper and lower case letters,
              symbols, and generally should be at least 15 characters.
              Generating random passwords and remembering different passwords
              for every site where you have an account is impossible. To solve
              this problem, there are password managers. These are apps that are
              password protected that store all your other passwords. Because
              they contain all your other log in credentials, it is extremely
              important that you properly protect your password manager. This
              means using a strong, random password that you have never used
              anywhere else. You can use this site to generate a strong password
              for your password manager:
              <a href="https://1password.com/password-generator/"
                >https://1password.com/password-generator/</a
              >. I recommend unchecking the "Full Words" box, and replacing at
              least one of the dashes with a number.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some people use notes applications or spreadsheets to keep track
              of their passwords. This is not recommended. Password managers,
              besides being much easier to use, are much more secure. Password
              managers are built with security as the primary goal, notes apps
              and spreadsheets are much easier for hackers to steal using
              malware or unauthorized access to your online accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, your password manager should have two factor
              authentication enabled, see the below section on two factor
              authentication.
            </p>
            <p>
              For choice of password manager, I highly recommend 1Password. It
              is extremely affordable at $2.99 a month for an individual, and
              $4.99 a month for a family (with up to 5 users). This is the best
              option in my opinion. If you prefer a free option, (although they
              also have a paid tier) I would recommend Bitwarden. I would not
              recommend LastPass due to their history of being breached. Proton
              and NordVPN both have started password managers. I have not used
              them, but given the reputation of these companies, they likely are
              good products. However they are newer products without the same
              history as Bitwarden and 1Password.
            </p>
            <p>
              Do not save passwords in Chrome or Firefox, they are trivially
              easy to steal if your computer is compromised, they are
              practically stored in plain text on your computer. Additionally,
              do not save passwords using your Google or Apple account, use a
              dedicated password manager. Because email addresses can often be
              used as a backup second authentication method, if someone gains
              access to your google or apple account, and your passwords are
              stored there, they likely will have full access to most of your
              online accounts.

            Two Factor Authentication
          </button>
          <div class="content1 text-left">
            <p>
              Two Factor Authentication (or 2FA) is a second piece of
              information required from a user in order to log in to an account.
              Often these are time-based, meaning a particular two-factor
              authentication code is only valid for a set period of time. There
              are four major types of 2FA, listed here in order from worst to
              best: SMS based, email based, software based, and hardware based.
            </p>
            <p>
              SMS based 2FA uses a code sent to your phone that usually expires
              in 5 to 10 minutes. SMS based 2FA is often used by banks, and is
              vulnerable to SIM swapping, and attack where a criminal takes over
              a victim's phone number. SIM swaps and compromised passwords are
              the source of many compromised bank accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Email based 2FA uses codes sent to your email address. A properly
              secured email account with a strong password and software or
              hardware based 2FA can be very secure. However, bear in mind that
              employees of your email service provider can gain access to your
              emails, and can also sometimes restore email access if you lock
              yourself out. There have been cases when hackers have called their
              victim's email service provider pretending to be their victim, and
              were able to reset the victim's email account password. Using an
              email provider like Protonmail that is security focused and
              employs zero knowledge encryption helps mitigate this risk
              greatly, as employees are less likely to be able or willing to
              reset an account's password. Using common email providers like
              Yahoo or Gmail for email based 2FA is not recommended.
            </p>
            <p>
              Software based 2FA uses a seed code and the time of day to create
              a six digit code that you enter into a website. Because the seed
              code is never entered into a website, and is often stored locally
              or in specially designed, secure applications, this method of 2FA
              is considered very secure. I highly recommend backing up your 2FA
              seed codes, however, often when you enable 2FA, the website will
              provide you with backup codes. In this case, backing up the seed
              code is not nessisary, add the backup codes to the notes section
              in your password manager. 1Password and Bitwarden paid tiers
              provides the option to save 2FA software codes in the app, and the
              app will generate verification codes. You can also just add the
              seed code in the notes section for a login as a backup, while
              using another app to generate verification codes. Regardless, you
              will also need a 2FA app specifically for your password manager.
              For a dedicated 2FA app, I would recommend Authy. I would avoid
              Google and Microsoft Authenticator due to privacy concerns, but if
              you don't share these concerns these apps also work well.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the image below you can see a screenshot from enabling 2FA in
              bitwarden. The QR code would be scanned with an app or a password
              manager. The alphanumeric code below the QR code is the seed code.
              If the site did not provide backup codes (bitwarden does), this
              seed code should be backed up in your password manager or another
              secure location, such as a thumb drive.
            </p>
            <img src="bitwarden2fa.png" alt="Bitwarden 2FA" />
            <p style="padding-top: 2rem">
              Hardware based 2FA uses a physical security key, often a USB key
              that you plug into the computer to verify your identity. These are
              considered the most secure method of 2FA. Yubico Authenticator
              keys are a great option for hardware based authentication keys. If
              you use hardware keys, make sure to buy two, and add both keys to
              each account where you use a hardware key. Then carry one with
              you, and keep one is a secure location. You don't want to be
              locked out of all you accounts because you lost your key ring.

            General Guidance on Password Managers
          </button>
          <div class="content1 text-left">
            <p>
              Once you have your passwords in a password manager, it is
              extremely important to maintain access to your password manager.
              There are multiple ways of doing this. For example, 1Password
              provides an "emergency kit" with your Secret Key, and your master
              password (make sure to add your seed code if you have 2FA
              enabled). With Bitwarden, you can make your own emergency kit by
              noting your password and 2FA seed or backup code in a text file or
              on paper. Storing this in a safe place, physically in a locked
              safe or filing cabinet, or digitally on a thumb drive stored in a
              locked location or password protected, will let you recover access
              to your account if you forget your password or if your logged in
              devices are lost or destroyed. You can also store this information
              in the password manager of a trusted friend family member.
              Remember that they can use this information to log into your
              password manager and access all your accounts. Only give this
              information to someone you trust absolutely.
            </p>
            <p>
              If storing your emergency kit digitally, after copying the
              information to a thumb drive, make sure the file is erased from
              your computer. This information should not be stored on any device
              connected to the internet, and it is easy to forget to delete the
              file after copying to a thumb drive.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you ever need to recover a 2FA code, all 2FA apps have an
              option to manually enter the 2FA seed code. Once you enter your
              backedup seed code, the app will start generating verification
              codes for the account.
            </p>
            <p>
              To reiterate, if you use Bitwarden, make sure to enable 2FA.
              1Password uses a secret key, so this is less important, but still
              a good idea. After this is set up, make sure that you have
              everything you need to log back into your password manager
              (password, Secret Key if applicable, and 2FA seed code) stored in
              a safe, secure location offline. If you forget and loose your
              password manager password, the password manager company will not
              be able to restore your access or recover your passwords.

            <p>
              The following are the steps to securely set up a Bitwarden
              account. Setting up 1Password is very similar, and more intuitive,
              so a step-by-step is not provided for that platform.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Ensure you have a 2FA app downloaded and ready to use.</li>
              <li>
                Go to hxxps://bitwarden[.]com/, and click get started in the top
                right corner.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use your email address to sign up, ensure the email you use to
                sign up is secure and has 2FA enabled. Some people prefer to
                have an email address used only for high security accounts such
                as banking and password managers. I recommend this approach, but
                it is not stricly nessisary especially if your standard email
                account is secured properly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use a password you have not used anywhere else, and do not use a
                variation of passwords you have used elsewhere. See the
                passwords section above for advice on creating a secure
                password.
              </li>
              <li>
                Create your account and verify your email address. (You will be
                sent an email with a verification link, click that link to
                verify your email. If you do not receive this email, there is an
                option in the website version to resend the email)
              </li>
              <li>
                Download the desktop application, as well as the mobile
                application if desired, and sign in.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the web version, click the profile image in the top right
                corner, then click “Account Settings”
              </li>
              <li>
                On the left side, navigate to Security, then on the top bar,
                select “Two-step login”
              </li>
              <li>Next to “authenticator app” click “manage”.</li>
              <li>Enter your password.</li>
              <li>
                Scan the QR code using your chosen authenticator app. Copy the
                code below the QR code to your clipboard (This is called a seed
                code). Do NOT click enable yet. (Note that you can add 2FA
                access to multiple apps by scanning this code from multiple
                authenticator apps, for example if you want to have a trusted
                friend or partner to also add your account to their
                authenticator app to ensure you maintain access to the account.
                )
              </li>
              <li>
                Open your Bitwarden Desktop App, select the + at the bottom, and
                create a login with the name “Bitwarden Seed Code”. Paste the
                code from below the QR code into the password field. No username
                is required. Save the entry.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the web version of Bitwarden, enter the six digit code from
                your authenticator app, and now click enable. (You may be
                required to enter an authenticator code into the desktop and
                mobile applications after enabling Two-step login.) Your
                password manager is now ready to use and secure. Next you will
                make sure you retain access to the password manager in case you
                loose access to your authenticator app.
              </li>
              <li>
                As mentioned above, you need to backup the password and the 2FA
                seed code. You can write down the code and password and keep it
                in a very secure place, such as in a safe. You can also store it
                on a USB flash drive, preferably encrypted. (SanDisk USB drives
                come with easy out of the box encryption capabilities.) Of
                course make sure you do not lose the password to the encrypted
                drive. Do whatever makes the most sense for your situation, but
                ensure that you do not lose your password manager password or
                seed code.
