          <h1>Learn the Basics of Personal Cyber Security</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to Security Tux. I hope to create straightforward guides
            that anyone can follow to improve their personal cyber security and
            stay safe online. In the guides found here I will point frequently
            to additional recources, but hope to create a comprehensive starting
            point. While there are no iron-clad security measures, if you follow
            these guides you will be well on your way.

            Why Listen to an Internet Stranger on Cyber Security
          </h3>
          <p>
            Working in the field of cyber security sent me down a rabbit hole
            learning about personal cyber security and privacy. After being
            asked by friends and family members about how they could stay safe
            online, I decided to try to create a recource with plug and play
            guides that anyone can use to help improve their online safety. The
            information in these guides comes from both my professional
            expirience in cyber security, as well as what I've learned on my own
            during my time down the rabit hole.
