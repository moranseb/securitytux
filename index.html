          <h1>Learn the Basics of Personal Cyber Security</h1>
          <p class="text-start">
            Welcome to Security Tux. I hope to create straightforward guides
            that anyone can follow to improve their personal cyber security and
            stay safe online. In the guides found here, I will frequently link
            to to additional recources if you are interested, but my goal is to
            create a comprehensive starting point. While there are no iron-clad
            security measures, if you follow these guides you will be well on
            your way.

          <h3>Why Listen to an Internet Stranger on Cyber Security</h3>
          <p class="text-start">
            Working in the field of cyber security sent me down a very deep
            rabbit hole learning about personal cyber security and privacy.
            After being asked by friends and family members about how they could
            stay safe online, I decided to try to create a recource with plug
            and play guides that anyone can use to help improve their online
            safety. The information in these guides comes from both my
            professional expirience in cyber security, as well as what I've
            learned on my own during my time down the privacy rabit hole.
